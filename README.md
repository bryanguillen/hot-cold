# Hot & Cold

## Summary 

Small React App as HOT | COLD game. The user needs to guess a number from 1 - 100. The computer, generates a random number, 
and it then shows feed back, hot (being close) &  cold (being far off the number). Lastly, if the user is right, display 
the right message and reset game. 

The app is super simple; it has just one button, one input field, a section to show feedback, guess #, and also the previous guesses.
